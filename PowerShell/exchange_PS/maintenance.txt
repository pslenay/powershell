And what’s the procedure for putting Mailbox Servers that are Database Availability Group Members into Maintenance mode?

1. Drain active mail queues on the mailbox server

    Set-ServerComponentState exch2047 -Component HubTransport -State Draining -Requester Maintenance

2. To help transport services immediately pick the state change run:

For Mailbox Server role:

    Restart-Service MSExchangeTransport

If the server is a multi-role server(CAS/MBX) you need to run

    Restart-Service MSExchangeTransport

    Restart-Service MSExchangeFrontEndTransport

3. To redirect messages pending delivery in the local queues to another Mailbox server run:

    Redirect-Message -Server exch2047 -Target exch2016.loesk.lokal

Note: The target Server value has to be the target server’s FQDN and that the target server shouldn’t be in maintenance mode.

4. To prevents the node from being and becoming the PAM, pause the cluster node by running

    Suspend-ClusterNode exch2047

5. To move all active databases currently hosted on the DAG member to other DAG members, run

    Set-MailboxServer <ServerName> -DatabaseCopyActivationDisabledAndMoveNow $True

6. Get the status of the existing database copy auto activation policy, run the following and note the value of DatabaseCopyAutoActivationPolicy, we will need this when taking the server out of Maintenance in the future

    Get-MailboxServer exch2047 | Select DatabaseCopyAutoActivationPolicy

To prevent the server from hosting active database copies, run

    Set-MailboxServer exch2047 -DatabaseCopyAutoActivationPolicy Blocked

7. To put the server in maintenance mode run:

    Set-ServerComponentState exch2047 -Component ServerWideOffline -State Inactive -Requester Maintenance

Note: Closely monitor the transport queue before running the step above , queues at this stage should be empty or nearly empty, as we will be disabling all server components, any mails still pending in the queues will have delay in delivery till the server is taken out from maintenance mode.

 

How can I verify that the server is into Maintenance mode?

To verify the server has been placed into maintenance mode, run:

    Get-ServerComponentState exch2047 | ft Component,State –Autosize

All components should show “Inactive” except for Monitoring and RecoveryActionsEnabled 











For Mailbox Servers that are Database Availability Group Members

1. To designate that the server is out of maintenance mode and be able to resume its previous tasks, run:

    A. Set-ServerComponentState exch2047  -Component ServerWideOffline -State Active -Requester Maintenance

    B. Resume-ClusterNode exch2047 

    C. Set-MailboxServer exch2047 -DatabaseCopyActivationDisabledAndMoveNow $False

    D. Set-MailboxServer exch2047 -DatabaseCopyAutoActivationPolicy Unrestricted

    Note: If the activation policy value was set to blocked before you started Maintenance, you must skip “D”

    E. Set-ServerComponentState exch2047 -Component HubTransport -State Active -Requester Maintenance

2. To help transport services immediately pick the state change run:

    Restart-Service MSExchangeTransport

If the server is a multi-role server (CAS/MBX) you need to run

    Restart-Service MSExchangeTransport

    Restart-Service MSExchangeFrontEndTransport

How can I verify that the server is out of Maintenance mode?

To verify the server is not maintenance mode, run:

Get-ServerComponentState exch2047 | ft Component,State –Autosize
